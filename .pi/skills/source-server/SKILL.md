  Start, stop, restart, reload, and inspect the source-be Clojure backend server
  running in a detached tmux session, without opening an editor. Boots an nREPL
  via ./nrepl.sh in tmux, connects over a TCP socket, and sends bencode ops to
  load-file dev/dev.clj (equivalent of Calva "Load File") then evaluate
  (server/start-server) from the rich comment block. Use when the user says
  "start the source server", "start the backend", "boot the clojure server",
  "run source-be without the editor", "stop the source server", "restart
  source-be", "reload source-be", "is the source server running", or otherwise
  asks to manage the source-be Clojure server lifecycle. Only use in the
  source-be repo.

# source-server

Manages the source-be Clojure backend as a background process: an nREPL server
runs in a detached tmux session, and this skill talks to it over a TCP socket
with bencode nREPL ops — exactly what Calva does when you "Load File" on
`dev/dev.clj` and then evaluate `(server/start-server)` in its rich comment
block. No editor required.

All plumbing is wrapped in `scripts/source-server.sh` (tmux + orchestration)
and `scripts/source-server-client.clj` (the bencode nREPL client, modeled on
the repo's `scripts/reload.clj`). Call the shell script; never drive tmux or
the nREPL socket by hand.

## Prerequisites

- `tmux`, `bb` (babashka), and `clojure` on `$PATH`.
- Run from the **source-be repo root** (must contain `dev/dev.clj`, `nrepl.sh`,
  and `.env`). The script checks and errors if not.
- `.env` must exist (nrepl.sh sources it for DB/config vars).

## Usage

```bash
./scripts/source-server.sh start       # boot nrepl in tmux, load dev.clj, start server
./scripts/source-server.sh stop        # kill the tmux session (nrepl + server down)
./scripts/source-server.sh restart     # stop + fresh start
./scripts/source-server.sh status      # tmux session + (server/running?) via nrepl
./scripts/source-server.sh logs        # tail last 50 lines of the nrepl pane
./scripts/source-server.sh logs -n 200 # tail last 200 lines
./scripts/source-server.sh reload      # (do (require 'dev) (dev/reload)) — hot reload
```

The tmux session name defaults to `source-nrepl`; override with
`SOURCE_NREPL_SESSION=<name>`.

## How to use this skill

1. Determine the action from the user's request (start / stop / restart /
   status / logs / reload).
2. Run `./scripts/source-server.sh <action>` from the repo root
   (`/home/keagan/dev/modulr/source-be`). Show the full output.
3. For `start`: the script starts nrepl in tmux, waits for `.nrepl-port`,
   sends an nREPL `load-file` op with the contents of `dev/dev.clj`
   (this is the Calva "Load File" equivalent — it evaluates the `ns` form,
   `(clj-reload/init ...)`, and the `defn`s; the rich comment block is
   skipped), then sends an `eval` op for `(server/start-server)` in the
   `dev` namespace (the form that lives in the rich comment block).
   `server/start-server` already guards against double-start, so `start`
   is idempotent.
4. If nrepl is already up (`.nrepl-port` present, e.g. the user ran
   `./nrepl.sh` themselves or Calva is connected), `start` reuses it and
   only does the load-file + start-server step. It does NOT start a
   duplicate nrepl. This matches the `clj-reload-workflow` skill's rule:
   assume the user's nrepl may already be running.
5. For `reload`: this runs `(do (require 'dev) (dev/reload))`, which is the
   same as `bb scripts/reload.clj`. clj-reload unloads changed namespaces,
   `before-ns-unload` stops the server if running, `after-ns-reload` starts
   it again. Use this after editing Clojure files to hot-reload without
   restarting the JVM. The `clj-reload-workflow` skill governs the
   edit-reload loop in detail — defer to it for the reload-after-edit
   rules.
6. For `stop`: kills the tmux session, which tears down the nrepl JVM and
   the http-kit server together. There is no graceful-only-server stop
   here; if you need to stop just the http server but keep nrepl, run
   `bb scripts/source-server-client.clj stop-server` instead.
7. Report back the session name, the port (from `.nrepl-port`), and how to
   attach (`tmux attach -t source-nrepl`) or view logs. Do not attach
   yourself — the agent cannot hold an interactive tmux session; the user
   attaches in their own terminal.

## Defaults

| Thing | Default |
|-------|---------|
| tmux session | `source-nrepl` (`SOURCE_NREPL_SESSION` to override) |
| nrepl launcher | `./nrepl.sh` (sources `.env`, runs `clojure -M:nrepl`) |
| file loaded | `dev/dev.clj` |
| server start form | `(server/start-server)` evaluated in namespace `dev` |

## Notes

- `start` waits up to 120s for `.nrepl-port` to appear (cold JVM startup).
  If it times out, point the user at `tmux attach -t source-nrepl` to see
  the Clojure stacktrace.
- `logs` uses `tmux capture-pane` so the agent can read output without
  attaching.
- Never run `tmux attach` from the agent — it blocks. Tell the user the
  command instead.
- This skill is for the source-be repo only; it verifies `dev/dev.clj` and
  `nrepl.sh` are present in the cwd.
